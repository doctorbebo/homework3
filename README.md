This project's purpose was to put into practice what we have learned of JavaScript. While at the same time,
reiterating and building our skills with html and css. This assignment also taught us how to implement a user 
interface. Furthermore, I had to touch on textarea and input tags and how they function with code differently.

I tools I used were the basic ones. Html, css and Javascript. I stayed away from bootstrap to learn more about 
css. I did, however, use concept of rows to build my site. I used web APIs as well especially event listeners.
I also used an execCommand to copy the text within the text area. I also used input tag and textarea tag in 
html in order to create the fully functional site.

With internet security threat continue to grow, having a better password will become a necessity. This site
allows the user to set parameters of their desired password. Then, it generates a random password. The user
can simply click the "copy to clipboard" button to quickly access the generated password.
